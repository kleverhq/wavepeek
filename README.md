# wavegrep

🚧🚧🚧 **EARLY STAGE OF THE PROJECT. UNDER CONSTRUCTION** 🚧🚧🚧

`wavegrep` is a command-line “grep-like” tool for waveform inspection. It provides deterministic, machine-friendly output and a minimal set of primitives that compose into repeatable debug recipes.

Primary goals:

* Fast signal discovery (hierarchy + regex search)
* Fast extraction of values/changes over time ranges
* “Find time when condition holds” queries for root-causing failures
* Stable text and JSON output for tool chaining and LLM agents
